# Render MDX with NextJS App router, dynamic segments

- Browser does not understand MDX out of the box. So here's where we need help of a few packages that next provides us.
- Why aren't the styles getting appended

```cmd
yarn add install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @types/mdx
```

These packages are used to intercept the string data and convert into proper html by mdx-remote

```cmd
yarn add remark-gfm rehype-slug rehype-autolink-headings @fec/remark-a11y-emoji remark-toc
```

but these packages have no meaning without remakr and rehype hence:

```cmd
yarn add remark rehype
```

# Hello World !

```js
function lorem(ipsum, dolor = 1) {
  const sit = ipsum == null ? 0 : ipsum.sit;
  dolor = sit - amet(dolor);
  return sit ? consectetur(ipsum) : [];
}
```

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

```styles.css
.lorem {
  color: #fff;
  padding: 10px;
  background: #000;
}
```
