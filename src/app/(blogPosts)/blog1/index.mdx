# About this project ^\_^

## Motivation

I always wanted to have my own website that I keep up to date with all relevant aspects of my life that I would like to share with others.
Also I was kind of getting bored and wanted to explore newer frameworks, hence this.

## Features

- #### Blog

  This wasn't in plan when I started building this but I decided to go ahead midway because I wanted to document the process.
  So what's better than just adding a section for such kind of stuff even for any other future projects that I may build or snippets that I use

- #### KaTeX math

  I've also added [KaTeX](https://katex.org/docs/supported) for easily writing math equations in the blog. So you could do something like:

  $$
  L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
  $$

  by simply doing this in your code:

  ```mdx
  $$
  L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
  $$
  ```

- #### Spotiy status

  Displays my currently playing song or the most recently played song on Spotify. This was super fun to implement. I had a lot of things in mind for this feature but given the time and my commitment to other things I couldn't explore all of them.

- #### Light and Dark mode
  Pretty much a standard in modern applications and websites. I didn't think this would be complete without this feature.
