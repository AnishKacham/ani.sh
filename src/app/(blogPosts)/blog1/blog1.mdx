# Render MDX with NextJS App router, dynamic segments

- Browser does not understand MDX out of the box. So here's where we need help of a few packages that next provides us.
- Why aren't the styles getting appended

```javascript
yarn add install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @types/mdx
```

These packages are used to intercept the string data and convert into proper html by mdx-remote

```javascript
yarn add remark-gfm rehype-slug rehype-autolink-headings @fec/remark-a11y-emoji remark-toc
```

but these packages have no meaning without remakr and rehype hence:

```
yarn add remark rehype
```
