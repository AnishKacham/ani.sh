# About this project üòÅ

## Motivation

I always wanted to have my own website that I could keep up to date with all my relevant activity to share with people.
It was also getting boring during the break after my graduation and wanted to explore newer frameworks, hence this.

## Features

- #### Blog

  This wasn't in my plan when I started building the website, but I decided to go ahead midway as it felt essential to document the stuff I did regularly.
  What's better than putting together a place for that by yourself :P. It's pretty simple for now with a list of all the blogs in reverse chronological order.
  Some other things I'm planning for the blog are support for search by tags / title / summary and image preview in the blog page.

- #### KaTeX math

  I've also added [KaTeX](https://katex.org/docs/supported) for easily writing math equations in the blog. So you could do something like:

  $$
    \oint_C {E \cdot d\ell = - \frac{d}{{dt}}} \int_S {B_n dA} \\
  $$

  by simply doing this in your code:

  ```mdx
  $$
    \oint_C {E \cdot d\ell = - \frac{d}{{dt}}} \int_S {B_n dA} \\
  $$
  ```

- #### Spotiy status

  I've been a pretty regular user of spotify for a while now.
  Although it's lost it's allure because of the [feud with Zee Music](https://www.billboard.com/pro/spotify-removes-indian-record-label-zee-music-company-catalog/)ü§¶,
  but hey the recommendation algorithm is still pretty solid. Also the model seems to be well trained for me with well over a year's worth of listening data which I will
  lose in case I shift to YT Music or some other platform.

  Coming to the feature itself, it was by far the most fun thing I've implemented for this project (especially the equalizer simulation).
  As of today it just shows the current playing song or the most recently played one on Spotify. Again had some super interesting ideas to explore like,
  picking the major color from the album art and using it as the background for the button, actually synchronising the equalizer to the beats of the song, etc.
  Hopefully I'll get back to them soon.

  I'd love to ship this equalizer version of spotify status as an npm package. Saving it for another day :)

- #### Dark mode
  I don't even know if it's huge enough for it to be here as it's pretty much standard nowadays.
  The project would have felt incomplete without the dark mode support.
