# Hello World !

```js
function lorem(ipsum, dolor = 1) {
  const sit = ipsum == null ? 0 : ipsum.sit;
  dolor = sit - amet(dolor);
  return sit ? consectetur(ipsum) : [];
}
```

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

```styles.css

- Some blogs that really really helped me setup this blog :p

- Browser does not understand MDX out of the box. So here's where we need help of a few packages that next provides us.
- Once your mdx renders all the code snippets look very plain without a difference between languages. This is where you need a syntax highlighter. I've used [bright](https://bright.codehike.org/) for this as this was the only server rendered syntax highlighter I could find. Lemme know if you guys find anymore. Apart from that it also has a few nifty features like adding tabs for different files that you need to show, etc.

```cmd
yarn add install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @types/mdx
```

These packages are used to intercept the string data and convert into proper html by mdx-remote

```cmd
yarn add remark-gfm rehype-slug rehype-autolink-headings @fec/remark-a11y-emoji remark-toc
```

but these packages have no meaning without remakr and rehype hence:

```cmd
yarn add remark rehype
```
