I would often find myself with a couple of files having a merge conflict when I'm either rebasing, merging or cherry-picking

let's say I'm working on my feature branch called **foo** and there are some additional changes on the **main** branch that I want to incorporate into my branch. But I already made changes to my feature branch and **commited** them.  
So my branches now look something like this :

```bash
I--A--B--C--D--E  main
      \
       F--G--H  foo
```

If Someone has made a change on the exact same line of code in the exact same file as I did, in one of the commits C, D or E then I will definitely have a merge conflict thrown at me, when I run:

1. git merge main
2. git rebase main
3. git cherry-pick \< commit hash of conflicting commit >

Sometimes I just want the version of the file from _main_ and then I'll amend my latest commit / make a new commit to make my changes again in that file.  
In this case I would do :

#### for merge

```sh
git merge main
git checkout --theirs <file_name_of_conflicted_file>
git add <file_name_of_conflicted_file>
git merge --continue
```

or

#### for cherry-pick

```sh
git cherry-pick b5fde68
git checkout --theirs <file_name_of_conflicted_file>
git add <file_name_of_conflicted_file>
git cherry-pick --continue
```

or

#### for a rebase

```sh
 git rebase main
 git checkout --ours <file_name_of_conflicted_file>
 git add <file_name_of_conflicted_file>
 git rebase --continue
```

**--ours and --theirs are inverted for rebase lol. Why?**  
when we do a rebase, internally
git rebase main (in my case, i.e, the example above) translates to :  
git checkout main  
git cherry-pick F  
git cherry-pick G  
git cherry-pick H  
 .... and then some renaming logic to finish the rebase

so to pick the files from main, you actually have to use the --ours flag

### A Shorter way

If I know before hand that there are going to be merge conflicts and I want all conflicted files to be from **main**

#### for a merge

`git merge -X theirs main`

#### for a cherry-pick

`git cherry-pick -X theirs b5fde68`

#### for a rebase

`git rebase main -X ours`
